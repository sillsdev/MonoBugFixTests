MonoBugFixTests
===============

This project contains unit tests for the different bugs we're fixing in mono-sil.

When we update to a later Mono version we can re-run the tests to make sure that
they all still pass.

Relying on the tests in the mono tree is a little less reliable since tests might get
crippled by the merge.
